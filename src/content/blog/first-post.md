I'm Jon Guymon. It occured to me recently that I spend an inordinate amount of time counting. Partly this is because of my job, partly my various hobbies, but more than anything, the human condition.

- **Work**
  - I work for an observability company, [New Relic](https://newrelic.com).
- **Hobbies**
  - Many of my past times are numerate in one way or another.
  - Games
    - Mostly of the video- board- and role-playing- varieties. The tracking of points, score, stats can get pretty intense.
  - Bodybuilding
    - I'm an amateur bodybuilder. Success in bodybuilding depends on two main activities.
      - Lifting: reps, sets, weight, periodicity, timing, tons of things to measure and obsess over.
      - Diet: Calories, macros, timing, body weight, body composition, even more to obsess over - not always in a healthy way.
  - Electronic Music
    - The link between music and math is well known.
  - Coding
    - I code for work, though much less than I used to. I mostly write documents and attend meetings now. I still enjoy coding, though, and look for ways to engage with code outside of work - like with this blog here.
- **Life**
  - The passage of time, the accumulation of money, are you getting enough sleep? are you drinking enough water? is your cholesterol in a healthy range? how many hours are your kids spending on their screens? how many posts have you made this week? how many likes did they get? Are you monetized yet?
