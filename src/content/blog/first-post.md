I'm Jon Guymon. It occured to me recently that I spend an inordinate amount of time counting. Partly this is because of my job, partly my various hobbies, but more than these things, counting is simply part of the human condition. These are the topics on which I'm likely to elaborate.

### Work
I work for an observability company, [New Relic](https://newrelic.com). We pride ourselves on instrumenting and measuring anything technology-related. I've been at New Relic for a nearly uncountably long time, over 13 years, and in that time I've worked on many parts of the various products. I'm probably most proud of the work that I did on our internal timeseries database, responsible for the literal counting of telemetry events and observability signals.

### Hobbies
Many of my past times are numerate in one way or another.

#### Games
Mostly of the video- board- and role-playing- varieties. The tracking of points, score, stats can get pretty intense. I go through phases with various competetive video-games where I start analysing my successes and failures looking for opportunities to improve. I did this with [League of Legends](https://leagueoflegends.com/en-us/), [MechWarrior Online](https://mwomercs.com/), [Titanfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanfall_(video_game)), and [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/).

I also enjoy more analog games, many of which have pretty intense numerical models you need to keep in your head. Table top war games, like [Warhammer 40k](https://warhammer40000.com/), are particularly demanding, but even easy-going narrative role-playing games like [D&D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) have their share of stats and probablilities to track.

#### Bodybuilding
I'm an amateur bodybuilder. I enjoy participating in regional competitions, and generally do pretty well in my age group (Masters). There are two main categories of activity required for success in bodybuilding; lifting and diet.

**Lifting**: reps, sets, weight, periodicity, timing, tons of things to measure and obsess over.

**Diet**: Calories, macros, timing, body weight, body composition, even more to obsess over - not always in a healthy way.

#### Electronic Music
The link between music and math is well known. I grew up around electronic music, in particular dance music, and it has always had a big impact on my life. The underground scene in the 90s, festivals in the 00s, the more contemplative movement of the 10s, and now what's going on with social media; it's all been fascinating to witness.

#### Coding
I code for work, though much less than I used to. I mostly write documents and attend meetings now. I still enjoy coding, though, and look for ways to engage with code outside of work - like with this blog here.

### Life
The passage of time, the accumulation of money, are you getting enough sleep? are you drinking enough water? is your cholesterol in a healthy range? how many hours are your kids spending on their screens? how many posts have you made this week? how many likes did they get? Are you monetized yet?
